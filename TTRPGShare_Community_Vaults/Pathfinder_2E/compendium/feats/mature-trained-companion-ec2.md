# Mature Trained Companion  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](/rules/traits/archetype.md)  [uncommon](/rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Animal Trainer Dedication](/compendium/feats/animal-trainer-dedication-ec2.md)

Your animal companion grows up, becoming a mature animal companion. Increase its proficiency rank in [Performance](/compendium/skills.md#Performance) to expert instead of one of the three skill increases for mature. It gains the Mesmerizing [Performance](/compendium/skills.md#Performance) advanced maneuver (see below), rather than the normal advanced maneuver for its type.

## Mature Trained Companion leads to...

[Splendid Companion](/compendium/feats/splendid-companion-ec2.md), [Specialized Companion](/compendium/feats/specialized-companion-ec2.md)
