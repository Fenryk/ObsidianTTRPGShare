## Plugins Required To Use This Vault
- To read what [Relevant Path Links are](https://www.coffeecup.com/help/articles/absolute-vs-relative-pathslinks/), and why they are used. 
- [Admonition](https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-admonition) by [Javalant](https://github.com/valentine195). Seriously, half the files will not be pretty unless you have this. 
	- [pf2e-admonitions.json](pf2e-admonitions.json) to automatically load the admonition blocks. These have not been styled fully yet. They can be imported directly into Admonitions. 


## Directions
1. Install Admonitions from the Obsidian Community Plugins Page
2. Download [pf2e-admonitions](pf2e-admonitions.json).
3. Install [pf2e-admonitions](pf2e-admonitions.json) into the Admonitions settings page. 
4. Download the Compendium and Rules Folders into your vault.  Use the [Download Git Directory](https://download-directory.github.io) site for best results. 
5. The GM-Screen, and Spells-Dataview folders are optional. 


## Attributions
This community vault has been brought to you by the efforts of many individuals. 

- [eBullient](https://github.com/ebullient), for their [TTRPG-Covert-CLI](https://github.com/ebullient/ttrpg-convert-cli) which pulls the data from PF2ETools and converts it to Markdown Form.
- [Javalant](https://github.com/valentine195), for their useful plugins helping make some of the painful parts of this process much easier. 
- [Sigrunixia](https://github.com/sigrunixia), eventually, for their over-spazzing on the CSS and getting the thing uploaded onto the Vault.
- [Robinsving](https://github.com/robinsving), whose dataview spells will will get re-added to the CLI spell format, soon. (I promise.)
