# Nimble Roll  *Feat 8*  
[rogue](/rules/traits/rogue.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Nimble Dodge

You throw yourself into a roll to escape imminent danger.

You can use Nimble Dodge before attempting a Reflex save in addition to its original trigger. If you do, the circumstance bonus applies to your Reflex save against the triggering effect.

When you use Nimble Dodge and the triggering attack fails or critically fails, or when you succeed or critically succeed at the saving throw, you can also [Stride](/rules/actions/stride.md) up to 10 feet as part of the reaction. If you do, the reaction gains the [move](/rules/traits/move.md) trait.

You can use Nimble Roll while Flying or Swimming instead of [Striding](/rules/actions/stride.md) if you have the corresponding movement type.
