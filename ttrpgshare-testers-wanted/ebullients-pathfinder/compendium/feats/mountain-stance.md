# Mountain Stance  [>](/rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 1*  
[monk](/rules/traits/monk.md)  [stance](/rules/traits/stance.md)  

- **Requirements**: You are unarmored and touching the ground.
- **Activity** Single Action

You enter the stance of an implacable mountain—a technique first discovered by dwarven monks—allowing you to strike with the weight of an avalanche. The only [Strikes](/rules/actions/strike.md) you can make are falling stone unarmed attacks. These deal `1d8` bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling group; and have the forceful, [nonlethal](/rules/traits/nonlethal.md), and [unarmed](/rules/traits/unarmed.md) traits.

While in Mountain Stance, you gain a +4 status bonus to AC and a +2 circumstance bonus to any defenses against being Shoved or Tripped. However, you have a Dexterity modifier cap to your AC of +0, meaning you don't add your Dexterity to your AC, and your Speeds are all reduced by 5 feet.

## Mountain Stance leads to...

[Mountain Stronghold](/compendium/feats/mountain-stronghold.md), [Mountain Quake](/compendium/feats/mountain-quake.md)
